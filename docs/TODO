Roadmap
=======

1.0: Pre-1.0 release actions
-----------------------------

* DocBlox gives the INFO that the version of DocBlox has changed when doing a first time parse
+ add $this (fluent interface) and self keyword to @return recognition
+ Add icons showing visibility / type to menu and method / property listings
+ Method name listing becomes badly readable when there are a lot of methods: http://t.co/txDP46U
+ When a file has 2 packages, a CRIT should be thrown because it causes rendering issues
+ Clicking in Search doesn't work in Aura _only under Chrome_; why?
* _Add documentation_
+ include section should be clickable (click-through)
+ Profile the application using XHProf to determine slow points and improve performance
+ Refactor mechanism which strips information from the path; it now checks the -d but should actually check what the
  lowest common folder is
+ Revise Page level docblock searching algorythm; with the introduction of namespaces has the @package tag become
  obsolete and it seems incomplete.
+ Validate each @param with the argument:
 + if an argument does not have the same type as the @param; throw an error
 + if the @param has multiple types and the argument has a typehint and not a default; throw an error
+ Add option to disable certain types of DocBlox errors per directory / file pattern
  ( i.e. check on file-level DocBlock; constant level DocBlock; etc)
+ Safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox

1.1: Add custom documents and statistics
-----------------------------------------

+ Add Docblock templates: http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html#basics.docblocktemplate
+ Add an option to auto-expand the sidebar on page load
+ Add small class diagram in class description showing all parents (and their parents) and direct children, preferably clickable
+ add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
+ add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
+ add mime-type option to long-description so that the transformation could change it into the required type: i.e. markdown = text/x-markdown
  + add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
+ Syntax highlight @example annotation content

1.2
---

+ Consider implementing disqus support
+ Add Twig output writer
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
+ Research: allow connections between multiple docblox generated files?
* UML Class Diagram
+ Do some grouping thing with the @since; it might be nice to get an overview what is added per version?

The Future
----------

* Mobile version
+ Refactor XSL templates to
  + Have a neat hierarchy in the file/content pages
  + Clean them up
  + Separate them further into distinct files
  + Allow for more modularity and easier templating by just including a header or so
+ Create an XSD for the structure file
* Improve exceptions per the PHP Coding Standards (http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/php-coding-standard)
* Refactor Static Reflection to
  * Be uniform with the Reflector interface and PHP's Dynamic Reflection
  * Move XML creation to the Parser

Technical Debt
--------------

* Add documentation
* Write unit tests
* Adopt PEAR standard; investigate PSR0

**More items will be added to this list as the project furthers.**
